     TAKE MY CAR NOW!!!!!!!</h2>

    This has been a great car, but I have access to newer cars now and
    don't want to bother fixing the few problems it has.  Nothing
    really major, it just needs a new battery and 2 new tires (one
    back tire is flat (quick leak, holds for a couple of days), and
    the full spare - not a donut - is leaky).  The two front tires
    were replaced about a year ago, without much driving on them since
    then.  The engine runs well, and there are no other mechanical
    problems that I know of.  It'll start and run like a champ, if you
    put a half-decent battery in it.

    The car was well taken care of before I stopped using
    it...regular oil changes/maintenance.  It has some rust on the
    exterior, but it appears to all be cosmetic, and could be easily
    repaired.

    I bought the car from a VW-only mechanic who had worked on my
    father's bus many years ago.  Since he retired I've mostly only
    taken it to other VW-only mechanics who seem to know what they're
    doing.

    I'm going out of town in about a week, so I need to get rid of
    this car quickly.  If you're at all interested, make me an offer!

    The car has a Thule roof rack on it that I'll probably throw
    in as well.
