ImageGroupLinkTag needs to support all combinations of options!
Implement Roll display page/controller
Put resin.conf into svn
Add preview images to album list page
Use CSS instead of <center>
handle images where the max size is less than large by not making a
huge copy in gather-images
make links to albums directory links


implement upload UI (don't forget height/width detection)

implement Roll, roll UI
IMPORTANT: how does the frame number get stored?
with roll in the photos table, no ImageFrame
abandon roll_id in images or add frame_no in images?
doing the latter seems that it would make the idea of an ImageGroup
sort of silly
maybe the two should be split up
in java space, could have two different objects descendent from
ImageGroup
slightly different semantics


refactor user, group to descend from Party

DONE: implement Album
DONE: implement ImageCD
DONE: implement UI: Album display, Roll entry, individual image display
