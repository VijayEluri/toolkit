I think we should have system-wide identifiers to select a size range:
thumbnail
small
medium
large
huge

5 seems like enough
we can always add ginormous if necessary

soo...what corresponds to those labels?
under PhotoCD:

huge: 3072x2048
large: 1536x1024
medium: 768x512
small: 384x256
thumbnail: 192x128



medium fills my browser screen, but in portrait it would be too big
different prefs for each
small is a bit too small to set for portrait

we'll go with this, for now


Default?  medium
selection? mf servlet param, album frame param
size=small
size=medium
size=thumbnail

select by area or by label?
if by label, then images without that label won't show up
if by size, we'll get the next closest
