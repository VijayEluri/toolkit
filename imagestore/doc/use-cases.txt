user's database of photos, uncategorized, unorganized
user has albums which represent arbitrary groupings of photos
any photo can be in 0..* albums
user can organize a slideshow, which is a sequenced grouping of photos
(is there any point in making a distinction between this and an album?
- I probably don't want to assign any particular order to an album, although this could just use the order in which the photos were added, possibly to be reorganized later)

user wants to add photos to database that shouldn't be available on the web
user wants to make photos/albums available only to his friends

user should be able to administer his own groups - friends, etc.
add/remove arbitrary user to any group the modifying user owns
create/delete groups - what happens to the referenced photos? pessimistic permissioning/access
