/images/display/by-id/562
/images/albums/by-name/bug-love/12
/images/rolls/by-id/46/36


pros:
- easy parsing
- clear URLS
- no extension (can change output format?)
 - specify type by content-type rather than extension
 - is there a header or something for filename?

cons:
- bad filenames
 - we could have a download link which gets the image by filename and
   id, placing the filename at the end to save properly
 - or we could use the name as the end of the URL
- no extension (although we could just add that)


- selecting by id is not a very human friendly method of URL
  specification
 - it would be better (in terms of URL) to specify by name
 - but that means that you have to specify a unique name for every
  photo, maybe categorized in a hierarchy...that's tricky
 - uniqueness within an album doesn't really help, because all images
  are (and should be, i think) fundamentally in a flat organization


variations:

alternate parameter and value
/images/display/id/562
/images/albums/name/bug-love/position/12
/images/rolls/id/46/position/36

this makes it a little bit more user-friendly


user?

/images/album/oliver/germany-2001/13
/images/album/oliver/burning-man-2003/22

/images/album : controller
              /oliver : user
                     /germany-2001 : album name
                                  /22 : frame number



select from users where user.name = 'oliver';
select from images, image_groups where images.owner_id

we can always have a different action name to select by parameter


argh
now we have two different actions:
if there's an ID at the end, show the individual frame
if there's not, show the album contents

there's probably a different view for standalone image display
vs. imageframe display, so maybe that's a good thing
controller just has to choose between two views

how to deal with album pagination?
query-string?

force trailing / on album name, user name, but not on image?

/images/album/oliver/?start=11
/images/album/oliver/germany-2001/
/images/album/oliver/germany-2001/?start=51
/images/album/oliver/germany-2001/1093


implementation:
use a command controller - the command object wraps the user, album
name, frame number combo

then just have to implement a way to create that object


user bookmarks album frame, then album changes - frame points to a
different image

/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/bach-haus-1
/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/wartburg-3

could make image name unique within its roll
then images have to be specified by roll and name
then we have 2 image groups in one url

/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/germany-3/wartburg-3

blech.

could give an additional name to the ImageFrame
blech. - too much data entry
could default from the image name, then ask if there are conflicts

could specify by image id

/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/100320
/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/2003
/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/1
/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/30204
/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/by-id/30204
/images/albums/oliver/germany-2001/image-id/30204


URL should be specified by Image, not ImageManifestation
that way, different MFs can be substituted according to user prefs

what if the album wants to specify a particular size? URL param?
that could be set in the ImageFrame if needed
should the URL specify an ImageFrame or an Image?
perhaps an ImageFrame tied to an Image
associate/identify ImageFrames with/by Image rather than position
