GOALS
- provide object-level access-control/permissioning (image/album)
- provide unauthenticated access to the application
- define system users
- allow users to own objects of multiple types (photos/albums)
- provide system-defined groups (everyone)
- provide predefined groups to which a user may add users (friends/family)
- allow users to define new groups, the membership lists of which the
user can define
- provide different views of objects based on access - owner gets edit
view (but can choose to see normal view), others get display view
maybe just different view components (edit form on display page,
comment form)
