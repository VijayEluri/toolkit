WONTFIX: refactor user, group to descend from Party

DONE: implement Roll, roll UI
DONE: Use CSS instead of <center>
DONE: Add preview images to album list page
DONE: Rolls link to individual rolls doesn't work with no trailing slash!
DONE: make links to albums directory links
DONE: Implement Roll display page/controller
DONE: implement Album
DONE: implement ImageCD
DONE: implement UI: Album display, Roll entry, individual image
display

DONE:
IMPORTANT: how does the frame number get stored?
with roll in the photos table, no ImageFrame
abandon roll_id in images or add frame_no in images?
doing the latter seems that it would make the idea of an ImageGroup
sort of silly
maybe the two should be split up
in java space, could have two different objects descendent from
ImageGroup
slightly different semantics
